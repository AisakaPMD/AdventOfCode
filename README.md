# Advent of Code

This repository contains my own codes, that I used to solve the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) challenges.
I try to use different languages over the month. To run a day's code, simply give an input file named "input" and fill it with your input.
Running the script should then give you the answer. They aren't the most opimized possible, but they usually are enough to solve the daily input.
